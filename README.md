# Next.js User List App

This is a simple web application built with Next.js that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a user-friendly manner. The application implements server-side rendering (SSR) and includes responsive and interactive user interfaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nextjs-user-list-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Making the Code Responsive

The code is designed to be responsive using Material-UI components and custom styling. It adjusts to different screen sizes for better user experience.

## Additional Notes

- The application fetches data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) to display a list of users.
- It includes a search bar for filtering users based on user input.
- Server-side rendering (SSR) is implemented for improved performance and SEO.
